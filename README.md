# Project Title

A smart contract-based token with an integrated vault system for asset management.

## Description

This project involves the creation of a token contract that adheres to the ERC20 standard, with additional features for managing player information and achievements. The token is designed to be used in various applications where users can earn and transfer tokens. Additionally, the project includes a Vault contract, which allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens in exchange for shares, implementing a form of tokenized asset management.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. **Download the Contract Files**
   - Clone or download the project repository from the source, such as GitHub.
   - Make sure you have the necessary development tools installed, including Solidity and an Ethereum development environment like Hardhat or Truffle.

2. **Setup the Development Environment**
   - Install Node.js if not already installed.
   - Install the Ethereum development environment of your choice. For example, if using Hardhat:
     ```
     npm install --save-dev hardhat
     ```

3. **Configuration**
   - Ensure the necessary configurations are set up in your project environment, such as network settings and Solidity compiler versions.

### Executing Program

1. **Compile the Contracts**
   - Use the following command to compile the Solidity contracts:
     ```
     npx hardhat compile
     ```

2. **Deploy the Contracts**
   - Create a deployment script for the `ERC20` and `Vault` contracts. For example, using Hardhat:
     ```js
     async function main() {
         const ERC20 = await ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20");
         const erc20 = await ERC20.deploy();
         await erc20.deployed();
         console.log("ERC20 deployed to:", erc20.address);

         const Vault = await ethers.getContractFactory("Vault");
         const vault = await Vault.deploy(erc20.address);
         await vault.deployed();
         console.log("Vault deployed to:", vault.address);
     }

     main().catch((error) => {
         console.error(error);
         process.exitCode = 1;
     });
     ```

   - Run the deployment script:
     ```
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
     ```

3. **Interact with the Contracts**
   - Use a tool like Etherscan or a frontend interface to interact with the deployed contracts. Functions like `transfer`, `mint`, and `deposit` can be tested using transaction interfaces.

## Help

For common problems or issues:

- **Compilation Errors:** Ensure all Solidity contracts are compatible with the specified version in the Hardhat configuration.
- **Deployment Issues:** Verify network configurations and contract addresses.
- **Execution Failures:** Check if the contract addresses are correctly configured and ensure that functions are called with the correct parameters.

For more help, you can run:
```
npx hardhat console
```
to interact with the deployed contracts directly in a console environment.

#### ERC20 Contract

- Implements ERC20 functionality with additional features for character management.
- Includes functions for transferring, approving, minting, and burning tokens.
- Provides player information management and achievement retrieval based on score.

#### Vault Contract

- Facilitates deposit and withdrawal operations, allowing users to exchange tokens for shares in a vault.
- Manages the minting and burning of shares based on the deposited or withdrawn amounts.
